# Hospital-Readmission-Prediction

Hospital readmission risk is the probability that a patient will return to the hospital
within a predetermined time frame following their original discharge.
Readmissions to the hospital can be expensive for both patients and the
healthcare system, and they may be a sign of underlying problems with the
standard of treatment or patient management.
Hospital readmission risk can be affected by a number of variables, such as the
patient's medical history, the seriousness of their sickness or condition, and any
comorbidities they may have. Patient demographics, such as age, gender, and
race, as well as social and environmental factors, such as housing and access to
healthcare, may also influence the likelihood of readmission.
